# AR-Spectacles-Fit-on
Augmented Reality Spectacles Fit-On app

<h4>⚫️ This is my final year project in university</h4>

<h4>About</h4>
AR Spects Fit-On is an app that can virtually apply spectacles frames to your face. With this app you can virtually get an image like the one you get by wearing Physical spectacles on your face. The purpose of this application is to minimize the need to select a spectacle frame using the physical fitting of the spectacle frame. This app virtually fits spectacles frames using AR technology. To do that you must have enabled ARKit on the iPhone. The ARKit feature is provided in Apple iPhone devices released after the Apple iPhone X. There is a hidden mask for face recognition, Unity software wants to use that mask to locate and adjust the point where the spectacle frames should be placed on a real face. Blender software is used to create 3D frame objects. The other parts are done by using Xcode.
